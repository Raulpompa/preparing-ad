<h1>Preparing Active Directory</h1>
<p>When preparing Active Directory (AD), I will create two VMs (Virtual Machines). One of the VMs will run a Windows Server to act as a Domain controller. The second VM will act as a client running Windows 10 to join the domain. In the upcoming projects, I will launch AD and run a script using PowerShell to create users in the domain. From there, I'll be able to log into the client VM and manage the accounts, as well as update group policies. Doing this will create a real-life Active Directory environment.  </p>
